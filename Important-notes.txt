Before using terraform resources we must spicfy provider (Amazon,Auze,etc). As this part is important in order to download the plugins for selected providers.

When we run the following command

terraform init --> it will look for the provider specified under the ".tf" file and based on it it will download the plugins for that provider.

In terraform we have three types of providers.
1) Hashicorp (Official provider maintained by Hashicorp)
2) Partner provider ( maintaince of this kinf is done by partner/company)
3) Community ( Used and created by person and maintained by person or a group)
Ex. 

Offical providers

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note in offical provide it can work in two ways as it officailly supported so soucre path filed goes to official 
Hashicorp directory
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# We strongly recommend using the required_providers block to set the
# Azure Provider source and version being used
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "=4.1.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Microsoft Azure Provider
provider "azurerm" {}


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note in partner provider we need to specify the path and "required_provider" field
as this is not official supported platform so it has different path which needss to be specified
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
terraform {
  required_providers {
    github = {
      source  = "integrations/github"
      version = "~> 6.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the GitHub Provider
provider "github" {}

Statefile : This would be created automatically whenever we apply any terraform file.

It stores the information about the resoucres created by terraform files in statefile. So it is recommended to keep a backup and not to edit anything under this file. As this file has all the information about the configured resouces using terraform apply.

Basically it sotres the information of all resaouces which were created in statefile.

Desired state: Terraform primary objective is to create modify and destory infrastructure to match desired state describe in terraform configuration 



Current state: Actual state of resource that is currently deployed
